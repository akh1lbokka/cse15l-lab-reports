> First thing I did here to get started was head over to the Visual Studio Code Website to download VSCode. VSCode is an Itegrated Coding Environment that is very helpful because it has a lot of features. The website is pretty easy to navigate, so download the VSCode software that is for your current operating system. Then, go through the steps to install the software and open it up. Your screen should look like the picture above

Next, open up a new terminal by going to the menu bar > terminal > new terminal. Type in `ssh <insert your @ieng username here>`. For example, I typed in `ssh cs15lwi22ajt@ieng6.ucsd.edu` (You can look up your email with UCSD's account lookup tool. If you are connecting for the first time, the terminal will ask you if you are sure you want to connect, type yes. Then, type in your password. Your screen should now look like the image above.
# Trying Some Commands

Now that you are connected, you can run some commands to test out the remote server. The image above provides some examples. `ls` lists all files in the current Directory. `pwd` means "print working directory", so it shows which directory you are in and how to get to that directory. `cd` means change directory, so using that followed up by another directory's name changes the director you are currently working with to the desired one.
